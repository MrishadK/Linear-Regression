# 📈 Linear Regression - Task 3

This project implements **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** models to predict housing prices based on a dataset.  
The project follows proper data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📚 Task Objective
- Implement and understand **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using **Scikit-learn**.
- Evaluate models using **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R² Score**.
- Interpret model coefficients.
- Visualize the regression results.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: Housing Price Prediction Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

---

## 🚀 Steps Followed
1. **Import the dataset** and explore it.
2. **Preprocess** the data (handled categorical features).
3. **Split** the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.
4. **Fit** a Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model`.
5. **Evaluate** the model using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
6. **Visualize** the Regression line.
7. **Interpret** model coefficients.

## 📈 Results

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: _`value_here`_
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: _`value_here`_
- **R² Score**: _`value_here`_

*(Actual values will be printed by the Python code.)*
